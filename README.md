Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project focuses on analyzing retail transaction data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, and analytical querying based on real-world retail use cases. The goal is to demonstrate SQL proficiency in solving business questions and supporting data-driven decision-making.

Project Overview

The dataset contains transactional-level information including customer details, purchase behavior, product categories, pricing, timestamps, and order values. The analysis is structured to reflect a typical business intelligence workflow: cleaning raw data, validating structure, exploring patterns, and answering targeted analytical questions.

Dataset Structure

The data is stored in a relational schema under the table retail_sales containing the following key fields:

Transaction ID

Sale Date and Time

Customer ID

Gender and Age

Product Category

Quantity Purchased

Price Per Unit, COGS, and Total Sale Value

The table creation script and source data can be found in the repository.

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning

Missing values across critical fields were identified and removed to maintain dataset integrity before analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial queries were used to understand dataset size, unique customers, product categories, and distribution patterns.

3. Business Case Querying

* Targeted queries were written to answer retail-specific analytical questions such as:

* Identifying peak sales days

* Segmenting customers by purchasing behavior

* Category-level revenue contribution

* High-value transaction detection

* Time-of-day based performance analysis
